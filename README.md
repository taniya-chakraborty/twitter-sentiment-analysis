The objective of the project "Social Media Sentiment Analysis using K Means Clustering Algorithm" is to analyze and classify sentiments expressed in social media, particularly on Twitter. The project aims to:

1. Categorize Tweets: Identify and categorize tweets into different sentiment classes, such as positive, negative, and neutral. This classification helps in understanding public opinion and sentiment trends.

2. Assess Subjectivity: Evaluate the subjectivity of the tweets, distinguishing between objective and subjective expressions. This aspect is crucial for understanding the nature of the sentiments being expressed.

3. Utilize K-Means Clustering: Employ the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar tweets based on their sentiment scores. This clustering helps in uncovering patterns and relationships within the data, providing insights into how sentiments are distributed across different topics or events.
